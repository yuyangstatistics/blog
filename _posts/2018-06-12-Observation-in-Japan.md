The first day in Japan.

We arrived at Japan at about 3:40PM at local time zone. The first thing that I was amazed by is the toilet. Each room has a music player to counter the noise made. The paper is recycleable.

The second day in Japan.

This part was written in June 9th at the Dezheng store.

The third day in Japan.

The fourth day in Japan.

This part was written in June 9th at the Dezheng store.

Today we went to the Osaka Castle. The main character of this castle is Toyotomi. This is a legend in Japan. I should spend some time later to learn more about this person.

Later in the afternoon, we spent nearly two hours walking around the shopping mall. I was amazed by the facilities in the central square.

The picture is not taken yet. I would add it tomorrow. Tomorrow we would go to the USJ for fun. Hope all is well!
