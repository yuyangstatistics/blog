3. Blink intentionally.
4. Close eyes periodically.
5. Massage eyebrows.
6. Work in well lit room.
7. Print out long documents.
8. Cybersickness happens due to conflicting sensory input, and therefore, to help our brain get a more consistent message is the key point. We have the following tips:
    - Reduce your mouse scroll speed.
    - Reduce your contrast and increase your font size. [Adjust contrast on Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2014/10/22/increase-contrast-mac-os-x-yosemite/)
    - Multitask. Spend a few minutes on your screens and then switch to something non-digital. Repeat.
    - Take longhand notes as you work. Jotting a few key points will help your eyes focus as you write, plus you're more likely to remember what you're reading or watching.
