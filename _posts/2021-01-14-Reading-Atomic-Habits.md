## The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

![compound-effect]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/20210114-compoud-effect.png)

> That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

> Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

![plateau-potential]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/20210114-plateau-of-potential.png)

> If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.

> It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once.

> Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. 

> Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
> Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
> Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
> Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

> We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

> The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.

> But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.


### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

> Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

![behaviour-change ]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/20210114-behaviour-change.png)

> With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.

> Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. 

> The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who **wants** this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who **is** this.

> The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. 

I am proud of my fingernails.

I am proud that I get up early and don't stay up.

> True behavior change is identity change. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

> The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
> The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.

> Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.3 For example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.


Find out the norms that I blindly attached to my identity.
- "I'm terrible with insisting good habits."
- "I'm not good at methamatics."
- "I cannot devote myself to research fully."
- "I'm not good at speaking."

> When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

> Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

#### The Two-Step Process to Changing Your Identity
> Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”

> Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it.  If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

> As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.

> This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. 

> The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

> It is a simple two-step process:
> 1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
> 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

The outcome I want -> Who is the type of person that can get these results? -> What could such a person do?

I want to lose weight. -> A healthy person. -> Always ask myself: What would a healthy person eat? How does a healthy person exercise? 

Act like a healthy person long enough, eventually I would become that person.

> Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. 

> It’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

> The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.


### How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

> Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.

> The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.

#### The science of How Habits Work

> cue, craving, response, and reward

> Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated. In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.

![four-laws]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/20210114-four-laws.png)

> Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself:
> 1. How can I make it obvious?
> 2. How can I make it attractive?
> 3. How can I make it easy?
> 4. How can I make it satisfying?

## The 1st Law: Make it Obvious

### The Man Who Didn't Look Right

> You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. 

> And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.

> Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

> The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.

> One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. 

> Create your Habits Scorecard. Make a list of your daily habits. Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. (Does this behaviour help me become the type of person I wish to be?) The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. 

> Try Pointing-and-Calling. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”  Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.

> Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,” increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the difference.

### The Best Way to Start a New Habit

> Implementation intentions leverage the two most common cues: time and location. 

> Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”

> People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. 

> The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: 
>
> I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
> - Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
> - Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom.
> - Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.

> There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.

> Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. 

#### Habit Stacking: A Simple Plan to Overhaul Your Habits

> One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit.

> The habit stacking formula is: 
> 
> “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
> - Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
> - Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.
> - Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened today.
> - Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am running and how long it will take.

![habit-stacking]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/20210114-habit-stacking.png)

> Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:
> 1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.
> 2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day.
> 3. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.

> Wirte down a list of habits that you do each day without fail (Get up, Eat breakfast) and a list of things that happen to you each day without fail (The sun rises). Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.

> Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.

> “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” Before or after lunch? Where to do them?
> “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.

### Motivation is Overrated: Environment Often Matters More

> People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it.

> Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.

#### How to Design Your Environment For Success

> Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them. Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. 

#### The Context is the Cue

> Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. 

> It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

> But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.

> Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”

Let my brain learn that bed is only associated with sleep. If I cannot fall asleep, go somewhere else till I am tired enough to sleep.

> Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness. 

> If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. Every habit should have a home.

> Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.


### The Secret to Self-Control

> Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.

> A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. 

> Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. 

> Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

> People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
