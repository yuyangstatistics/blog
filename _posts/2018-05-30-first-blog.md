This is my first blog. In this blog, I would illustrate why I build this blog and what I will log down in this website.

Several things I will do in my blog:
* Try to illustrate what I have learnt to examine whether I truly understand it or not.
* Log down my puzzles and how I solve it.
* Record some interesting and happy moments in my daily life.

I have decided to learn photography from now on. Maybe I would pause playing softball for some period and photography would be my future hobby. I found it very interesting through several hours' learning. Hope all goes well!

### Tips of the blog
- use * to reference the blog post I want to write, instead of inputing the whole name of the blog post.
