## TexStudio

## Set dark theme for TexStudio
1. Search for `.txsprofile` files to find the settings that you like. I personally like **zenburn** very much and I found a very helpful [link](https://gitlab.com/adin/texstudio-profiles). 
2. Find out the where the setting file is stored on you computer: [Where are the settings stored?](https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#where-are-the-settings-stored). For Mac, the `texstudio.ini` file is stored in `~/.config/texstudio/texstudio.ini`.
3. Open the setting file, edit the **formats** part by pasting the copied color settings in `.txsprofile`.
